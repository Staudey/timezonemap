libtimezonemap data files
=========================

A brief explanation of the files in this directory and how to generate the
ones that are generated:

admin1Codes.txt, cities15000.txt, countryInfo.txt
  These three files come from the geonames.org database. Simply find the files
  in http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/ and copy them to this directory.

citiesExtra.txt
  These are additional cities with populations less than 15,000 used to
  provide clickable locations for sparesly populated timezones. It consists of
  extra lines from the geonames database.

backward
  This file lists links between current time zone names and obsolete time zone
  names. It comes from the tzdata at https://www.iana.org/time-zones

  The location pin. Nothing fancy.

time_zones_countryInfo-orig.svg
  The master SVG used to generate the map images. It is lovingly hand-updated,
  mostly by using inkscape to trace over whatever map image is convenient.

  Each layer must also have an id corresponding to the layer name.

  The background layer is generated from the individual timezone layers. Here
  is one way to do it:

  * Open time_zones_countryInfo-orig.svg in inkscape
  * Open the layers dialog with Layer -> Layers...
  * Click "background"
  * Click the eye icon to make the layer visible
  * Edit -> Select All
  * Edit -> Delete
  * Right click over an ocean area, choose "Select This"
  * Edit -> Select Same -> Fill and Stroke
  * Edit -> Copy
  * Click "background" in the Layers dialog again
  * Edit -> Paste in Place
  * Open the Fill and Stroke dialog with Object -> Fill and Stroke
  * Under the Fill tab, change the RGBA value to 95a9c8ff
  * Layer -> "Show/hide current layer" to hide the background layer
  * Right click a land area, "Select This"
  * Edit -> Select Same -> Fill and Stroke
  * Edit -> Copy
  * Click "background" in the Layers dialog again
  * Layer -> "Show/hide current layer" to show the background layer
  * Edit -> Paste in Place
  * In Fill and Stroke, under the Fill tab, change RGBA to ffffffff
